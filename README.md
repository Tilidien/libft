LIBFT

This project is my libft for 42 that i extended while doing the various c projects 
the 42 offers.

HOW TO USE
make will crete libft.a outside of its folder. (sorry for that. woudlnt do it again now but now my older projects depend on that)
Include libft.h and link the lib while compiling and you are good to go.
